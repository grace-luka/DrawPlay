 * Class: The Scoretrakker class is where we are checking the files and the formatting
 * to make sure they are all valid. The processFiles() method is checking to
 * make sure that we are going to process a file that exists, if it doesn'tt exist
 * then we will throw and exception. The loadDataFile() method checks if the 
 * score of a student is an integer, if it is not it throws an error and doesn't
 * add the student to the final array list to print. The printInOrder() method sorts
 * and prints our array list after all exeptions may or may not have been thrown.
