 * Class: Snake - This class represents our snake gamepiece. The snake is moveable, drawable, and interacts.
 The snake moves forward one space if it can, if not it moves backwards if it can, and if not it stays still.
 Its interaction result is HIT, and it only hits if it is in the same location as the player.
