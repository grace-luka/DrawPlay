/**
 * Authors: Grace Luka and Caroline Schreier
 * Class: This class created our levels. Because the gameboard changes between levels this class had three
 * very important arrays that stored the information of our game pieces. The first array which contained
 * many of our game pieces was the interacting pieces array, any class that didnt result in a none interaction
 * was put into this list once and instance of the class was created. The next array was movable, this
 * array help instances of our snakes and frogs, once a snake or frog was created it was added to this
 * array to be used later by gameEngine. The last array was of the actual level of the game, this array held
 * all of the intances of the child classes because each of our gamepieces required to be added to the 
 * gamebaord. We also created the instances of each of the child classes by using the random function. This
 * allowed us to randomized if and where a game piece would be.
