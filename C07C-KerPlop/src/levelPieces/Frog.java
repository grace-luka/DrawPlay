 * Class: Frog - this class represents one of our moveable and interacting pieces. We implemented the 
 * interaction class when a player came within one space of the frog, but the player is allowed to step onto
 * the frog and take no damage. We also implemented the move method for this class, allowing the frog to
 * jump over a space on the next level.
